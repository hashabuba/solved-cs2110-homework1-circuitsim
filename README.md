CircuitSim is an interactive circuit simulation package. We will be using this program for the next couple of homework assignments. Before you start please ensure that you have at least Java 8u152 (JDK) installed on your computer. This may be a problem if you installed Java during CS 1331 last semester and never updated. Make sure you update to the latest version of Java 8! CircuitSim will only run on machines with at least Java 8 installed. Your next homework will involve programming in Java so make sure you have the JDK installed as well.

CircuitSim is a powerful simulation tool designed for educational use. This gives it the advantage of being a little more forgiving than some of the more commercial simulators. However, it still requires some time and effort to be able to use the program efficiently. With this in mind, we present you with the following assignment:

Part 1 — Read Resources

Read through the following resources

<ul>

 <li>CircuitSim Wires Documentation <a href="https://ra4king.github.io/CircuitSim/docs/wires/">https://ra4king.github.io/CircuitSim/docs/wires/</a></li>

 <li>Tutorial 1: My First Circuit <a href="https://ra4king.github.io/CircuitSim/tutorial/tut-1-beginner">https://ra4king.github.io/CircuitSim/tutorial/tut-1-beginner</a></li>

 <li></li>

 <li>1.2         Part 2 — Complete Tutorial 2</li>

</ul>

Complete Tutorial 2 <a href="https://ra4king.github.io/CircuitSim/tutorial/tut-2-xor">https://ra4king.github.io/CircuitSim/tutorial/tut-2-xor </a>Instead of saving your file as <strong>xor.sim</strong>, save your file as <strong>part1.sim</strong>.

<a name="_Toc3359"></a>1.3         Part 3 — Complete Tutorial 3

Complete Tutorial 3 <a href="https://ra4king.github.io/CircuitSim/tutorial/tut-3-tunnels-splitters">https://ra4king.github.io/CircuitSim/tutorial/tut-3-tunnels-splitters </a>Name the subcircuit <strong>umbrella</strong>, the input <strong>in</strong>, and the output <strong>out</strong>. Save your file as <strong>part2.sim</strong>.

<a name="_Toc3360"></a>2           Checker

To run the checker, run

$ java -jar hw01-tester.jar

at a command prompt in the same directory as part1.sim and part2.sim. Gradescope uses this same checker to evaluate your work.

Submit the following files:

<ul>

 <li>sim</li>

 <li>sim to Gradescope under the assignment “Homework 01.”</li>

 <li>     Syllabus Excerpt on Academic Misconduct</li>

</ul>

Academic misconduct is taken very seriously in this class. Quizzes, timed labs and the final examination are individual work.

Homework assignments are collaborative, In addition many if not all homework assignments will be evaluated via demo or code review. During this evaluation, you will be expected to be able to explain every aspect of your submission. Homework assignments will also be examined using computer programs to find evidence of unauthorized collaboration.

What is unauthorized collaboration? Each individual programming assignment should be coded by you. You may work with others, but each student should be turning in their own version of the assignment. Submissions that are essentially identical will receive a zero and will be sent to the Dean of Students’ Office of Academic Integrity. Submissions that are copies that have been superficially modified to conceal that they are copies are also considered unauthorized collaboration.

<strong>You are expressly forbidden to supply a copy of your homework to another student via electronic means. This includes simply e-mailing it to them so they can look at it. If you supply an electronic copy of your homework to another student and they are charged with copying, you will also be charged. This includes storing your code on any site which would allow other parties to obtain your code such as but not limited to public repositories (Github), pastebin, etc. If you would like to use version control, use github.gatech.edu</strong>
